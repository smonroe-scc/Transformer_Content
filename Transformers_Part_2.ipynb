    "Physical description of hysteresis: The magnetic core of a transformer is made of Steel, Iron, or some other magnetically permeable material. Steel is very good ferromagnetic material.<br><br> These kinds of materials are highly permeable to magnetic field lines.<br><br> That means that whenever magnetic flux passes through steel, it will behave like a magnet. Ferromagnetic substances have numbers of domains in their structure.<br><br> Domains are very small regions in the material structure where all the dipoles are parallel and in the same direction.<br><br> In other words, the domains are like small permanent magnets situated randomly in the structure of the material. These domains are arranged inside the material structure in such a random manner, that net resultant magnetic field of the material is zero.<br><br> Whenever external magnetic field or a magnetomotive force is applied to that substance, these randomly directed domains get arranged in parallel along the axis of applied magnetomotive force. After removing the external mmf, large numbers of domains relax to random positions, but some of them still remain in their changed position.<br><br> Because of these unchanged domains, the substance becomes slightly magnetized permanently.<br><br> This magnetism is called \"Retentivity\". To neutralize this magnetism, some opposite magnetomotive force is required.<br><br> The magnetomotive force is applied in the transformer core is alternating. For every cycle due to this domain reversal, there will be extra work done. For this reason, there will be a consumption of electrical energy which is known as Hysteresis loss of transformer."
